About me

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist with hands-on experience building, deploying, and scaling production-grade AI systems. My work spans predictive modelling, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, cloud deployment, and MLOps.

At AXA Mansard, I support core business operations by architecting data pipelines, developing machine learning APIs, optimising ETL workflows, and building analytics tools for decision-making.

I’ve also worked on AI pipelines for ExamRocket, open-source community projects, and various AI/ML competitions (Zindi, Kaggle, DSN). I enjoy building intelligent systems that are practical, reliable, and impactful.

I am deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning, cloud systems, and automation — and how AI can simplify workflows and empower teams.
